At Tesco Bank, I had a lead role in web application development as part of a company- wide digital transformation project. As the first developer to use React at Tesco Bank in late 2015, I wrote a large portion of the first React-based web applications developed, while providing support and guidance for other developers that were learning React, ES2017+ and modern JavaScript development.

Using a Node.js backend, Sass for styling, Redux Saga for state management and Jest with Enzyme for unit testing, I worked to make best use of the current technology while creating software that is modular and maintainable over the longer term.

Tech stack:

- React
- Redux (redux-thunk & redux-saga)
- JavaScript
- Storybook
- Webpack
- Node
- Jenkins
- Jest, Enzyme & WebdriverIO
