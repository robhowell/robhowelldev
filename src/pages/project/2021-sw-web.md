As the technical lead of a full stack agile project team, I worked primarily in the areas of UI engineering and technical strategy for the Scottish Widows Pensions Web App, a large customer facing React-based app at Lloyds Banking Group (LBG).

I led the strategy and implementation of cloud-based continuous integration pipelines using GitHub Actions, including unit testing with Jest, acceptance testing with Cypress and visual regression testing using Applitools.

During this project I built a suite of tools to simplify React development, encouraging best practices at scale. This includes a Storybook-based component library which enables reusable front end features to be built once then re-themed to support multiple brands, across multiple applications built at LBG.

The project team followed the Scrum methodology, using code reviews, automated testing and continuous integration using Jenkins to support rapid iterative development based on daily communication and feedback from the product owner. As a technical leader within the lab, I was responsible for mentoring a number of junior developers, and for the development and implementation of long-term strategy for the team.
